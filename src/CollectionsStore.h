// Books). The user can change the sort for any non-Recently-Added
// collection via the shelf-header "Sort by..." action.

  // EPUB metadata's <dc:creator> -- handles "First Last", "Last, First",
  // and falls back to the whole author string if no split point is
  // found). Books with no cached metadata or no author sort to the end.

// support. See spec in PR for the long-term shape.
