// Bottom-drawer-style quick settings menu shown in the reader on long-press of
// the menu button. Architecture and partial-refresh approach are adapted from
// inx (MIT, Copyright 2025 Dave Allie):
//   https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx — src/activity/reader/Epub/SettingsDrawer.{h,cpp}
//
// The drawer overlays the bottom ~60% of the screen (or right half in
// landscape) on top of the live reader page. It uses FAST_REFRESH so toggling
// items doesn't sweep the panel — only the changed pixels in the drawer
// region get repainted. The reader page underneath is preserved by storing
// the framebuffer on entry and restoring it before every drawer redraw.
